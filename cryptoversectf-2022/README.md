## My challenges

`CryptoverseCTF` came into shape as my acquaintance `Cryptoverse` wanted to host his own CTF. Since there were quite many "leftover" challenges from [SekaiCTF](https://2022.ctf.sekai.team/), or random ideas I wanted to implement, I helped him to author some challenges. It went very well as his first CTF, congratulations!

The CTF is overall beginner-friendly, and it mainly focused on crypto and reverse engineering. I personally think there were a few interesting ones (but probably not enough to fit into SekaiCTF xD).

This repository contains a selection of my challenges from the CTF.
