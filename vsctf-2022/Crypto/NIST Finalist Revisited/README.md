# NIST Finalist: Revisited

## Description

After careful consideration during the 3rd round of the NIST PQC Standardization Process, NIST has identified 4 candidate algorithms for standardization, which are...

Well, wait. This has nothing to do with the challenge.

After revisiting the 10 [Finalists](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/lightweight-cryptography/finalists) of the NIST *lightweight* crypto standardization process, I think [ASCON](https://ascon.iaik.tugraz.at/) hashing algorithm is a bit too slow with 12 rounds of functions. Maybe changing to 2 rounds could make it WIN the competition?
