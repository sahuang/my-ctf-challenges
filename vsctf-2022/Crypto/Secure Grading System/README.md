# Secure Grading System

## Description

VS University needs a reliable grading system for students' final reports. I was hired and designed the following scheme - upon testing, I can claim it is cryptographically secure. 

Can you show me it is unbreakable? I don't want someone else to forge student's signature and replace the original report...
