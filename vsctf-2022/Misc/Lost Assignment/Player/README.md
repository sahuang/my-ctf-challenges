# Lost Assignment

## Description

The final assignment of my Digital Systems course is to display the digit 4 in a logic circuit. I already finished my assignment in the software, but after I exported the circuit all data have been reset! I should really take a screenshot instead...

Can you help to recover my assignment? Wrap the message you got in `vsctf{XXXX}`.
