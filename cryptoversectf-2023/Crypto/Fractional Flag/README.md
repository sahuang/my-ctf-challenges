# Fractional Flag

My Cryptosystem is not used for encryption, but to break the flag into *fractions*.

## Solution

`solve.sage` contains my solution which is just to reference paper https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1241.pdf. Idea is basically continued fraction as hinted in challenge title.

I also attached [kanon](https://twitter.com/_k4non)'s solution script in `solve_kanon.py` who used `LLL`.
