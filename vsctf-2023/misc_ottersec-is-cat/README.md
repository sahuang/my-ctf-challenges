# OtterSec Is Cat?

## Difficulty: Easy

## Description

I trained a Convolutional Neural Network that can recognize ten different classes of images. The other day, *NotDeGhost* approached me and said: "Don't you know OtterSec is a Cat? Your model is broken!"

Unfortunately, my model seems to classify the OtterSec logo as a truck. Can you fix it?
