## Solution

1. Description mentioned the game Fall Guys, which is available on Steam, and game community, which points to Steam.

2. User search [sahuang](https://steamcommunity.com/search/users/#text=sahuang) and there are 2 accounts owned by the author. Check both to see [sahuang97](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199072861183) has Fall Guys gameplay history.

3. Check the [review](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sahuangowo/recommended/1097150/) to see the flag, which was uploaded in 2022: `vsctf{what_is_your_crown_rank}`
